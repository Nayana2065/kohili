    <p><i>In 2007, the Board of Control for Cricket in India introduced the Indian Premier League, a franchise-based T20 league. Among the franchises, Royal Challengers Bangalore, owned by Vijay Mallya at the time, <u>selected Kohli to join their team for a sum of $50,000</u> through a draft. <mark>This decision was influenced by his performance in the U19 World Cup in Malaysia which India won under him.</mark>
        In the inaugural IPL match, <u>Kohli played in a high-stakes encounter against the Kolkata Knight Riders where he lost his wicket early during the team's pursuit of a target of 223 runs.</u> As the event progressed, he found himself occupying a position in the middle order, but he was reinstated at the top order during the match against Deccan Charges. It was in this role that he rediscovered his form and made contributions to the cause.

    </h1></center>
    <p><b>Following Vettori's retirement, <i>Kohli assumed the role of full-time captain for the Bangalore team starting from the 2013 season of the IPL. </i>Prior to the commencement of this season, <mark>he was highest run-scorer for Bangalore with a tally of 1,639 runs.</mark>Kohli embarked on the tournament with a consistent start, but suffered a loss against the Sunrisers Hyderabad in an away game.In their subsequent home match, once again against Hyderabad, Kohli scored unbeaten 93 while chasing, marking his highest individual score in Twenty20 cricket at that time. Continuing his form, Kohli went on to score back-to-back fifties in the matches against the Chennai Super Kings and the Delhi Daredevils, the latter of which was decided through a super over. After a defeat against the Mumbai Indians, Kohli found himself embroiled in a disagreement with the crowd due to their aggressive demeanour towards the visiting team at the Wankhede Stadium. As the mid-season approached, Kohli encountered a dip in his performance, managing 45 runs in four innings.</b></p>
